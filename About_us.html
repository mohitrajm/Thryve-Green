    <h1>About Thryve Green</h1>
    <p>
      We want to turn India’s waste into clean energy, useful materials, and better solutions
      that reduce pollution and support people.
    </p>

    <h2>Why We Started Thryve Green</h2>
    <p>
      We started Thryve Green with a simple goal. Build something clean and practical that helps
      India reduce pollution without placing extra burden on people. Our first idea was to create
      products using bamboo. While researching that path, we realized how much agricultural waste
      India produces every year and how most of it ends up burned in the open.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, industries continue to rely heavily on coal and firewood. Both problems
      meet at the same point. Too much waste, high demand for energy, and very few long term
      solutions that connect the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is where we found opportunity. Even though biomass briquettes is a mature sector,
      India’s waste challenge is still massive. There is space for responsible companies to
      collect and convert this material instead of letting it burn. Starting here made sense.
      It is practical, proven, and builds the right foundation for our long term vision.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Believe In</h2>
    <p>
      We believe sustainability should be simple. When solutions are simple, people use them.
      When they work on the ground, they last. Our focus is to create products that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce pollution</li>
      <li>Support farmers</li>
      <li>Help industries shift to cleaner fuel</li>
      <li>Make waste useful</li>
      <li>Prepare India for higher energy demand</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Long Term Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Briquettes are our starting point. Over time, we want to explore more waste based products
      that can replace fossil materials. This includes options like biomass based fuels, biochar,
      bio-bitumen, and other clean alternatives that support industry and reduce environmental impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is clear. Turn India’s waste into clean energy and useful materials in a way
      that is practical for both businesses and communities.
    </p>

    <h2>Meet Our Core Team</h2>
    <p>We are three founders who want to build meaningful solutions for India’s future.</p>

    <h3>Sai Mohit Raj Male</h3>
    <p>
      Co-founder. Manufacturing Engineer with experience in robotics, process improvement,
      and CAPEX projects. Focused on building systems that scale and solutions that last.
    </p>

    <h3>Suchit Raj Male</h3>
    <p>

      and technical execution.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Work Matters to Us</h2>
    <p>
      India is growing in population, energy demand, and data requirements. At the same time,
      waste generation is increasing every year. If we do not create systems to convert this
      waste into useful material, we will face larger environmental challenges in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to be a part of the solution. We want to build something clean, reliable, and
      impactful. And we want to do it in a way that benefits farmers, industries, and communities
      at the same time.
    </p>

    <h2>Join Us in Building Something Better</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you are a farmer, business, or partner, we invite you to be part of a cleaner
      and more sustainable future.
